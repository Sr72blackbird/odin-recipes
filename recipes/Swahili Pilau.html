    What is Kenyan Pilau Rice?
</h1>
<p>
    Kenyan pilau rice is a simple dish of rice flavoured with meat stock and spices and sometimes cooked with vegetables. 
    This aromatic rice dish is commonly served at parties and occasions, usually with kachumbari (tomato & cucumber salad). 
    Similar to jollof rice in West Africa, it is always present on Eid, Christmas and other special occasions. 
    Kenyan pilau rice is also known as Swahili pilau rice and East African pilau rice.

Pilau dish is common in India and the Middle Eastern countries, each with its way of preparing it. 
The East African pilau rice is common in countries around the Swahili coast like Kenya and Tanzania;
 hence, it is also called Swahili pilau. 
</p>
<p>
    Although there are a lot of Indian influences in the local cuisine of the countries around the Swahili coast,
     The Kenyan or Swahili pilau 
    is more similar in appearance to the Middle Eastern version with a
     light brown colour than the Indian pilau with bright yellow colour from the addition of turmeric.
