    <h1>
Classic Kenyan Beef Recipe
</h1>
<p>
    I am glad to finally be able to share with you my classic Kenyan beef stew recipe. 
    Beef is slowly stewed in tomatoes, curry powder, and other spices to give you some hearty and 
    fork-tender stew to serve alongside some <a href="recipes/pilau.html">Swahili pilau</a> or your favorite side dishes!

You can make this beef stew on the stovetop or using your Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker
</p>
<p>
    Although there are a lot of Indian influences in the local cuisine of the countries around the Swahili coast,
     The Kenyan or Swahili pilau 
    is more similar in appearance to the Middle Eastern version with a
     light brown colour than the Indian pilau with bright yellow colour from the addition of turmeric.

    Ingredients
</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Beef</strong> - use other cuts of meat if you prefer, 
        just make sure that it does not have too many bones.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices</strong> - curry powder, black pepper, smoked paprika, turmeric.</li>
    <li><strong>Pantry staples</strong> - salt and olive oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> - red bell peppers, tomato, tomato puree, onion 
        and cilantro (optional). We use red onions in Kenya because they are more 
        readily available and affordable. You can also use some yellow onions. Other optional vegetables for this Kenyan beef stew recipe include carrots, peas, potatoes or green bell peppers.

</p>
<ol>
    <li>Using your blender or hand mixer, process onion, 
        the remaining salt, tomato, red bell pepper, and 
        tomato puree. Use a pestle and mortar to grind the 
        garlic and ginger. Alternatively, process the garlic 
        and ginger with the tomatoes in the blender if you prefer.

        fragrant then add the blended tomato mixture and stir.
